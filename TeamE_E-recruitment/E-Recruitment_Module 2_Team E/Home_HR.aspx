    E-Recruitment or eRecruitment is the process of personnel recruitment using 
    electronic resources, in particular the internet. Companies and recruitment 
    agents have moved much of their recruitment process online so as to improve
     the speed by which candidates can be matched with live vacancies. Using database 
     technologies, and online job advertising boards and search engines, employers 
     can now fill posts in a fraction of the time previously possible. Using an 
     online e-Recruitment system may potentially save the employer time as usually 
     they can rate the eCandidate and several persons in HR independently review 
     eCandidates.

The internet, which reaches a large number of people and can get immediate feedback 
has become the major source of potential job candidates and well known as online
 recruitment or E-recruitment. However, it may generate many unqualified candidates 
 and may not increase the diversity and mix of employees. In terms of HRM, the internet
  has radically changed the recruitment function from the organisational and job seekers
   perspective. Conventional methods of recruitment processes are readily acknowledged 
   as being time-consuming with high costs and limited geographic reach. However, 
   recruitment through World Wide Web (WWW) provides global coverage and easiness.
    Likewise, the speedy integration of the internet into recruitment processes is 
    primarily recognised due to the internet's unrivalled communications capabilities,
     which enable recruiters for written communications through e-mails, blogs and job 
     portals.
